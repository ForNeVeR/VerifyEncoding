encoding-verifier
=================
This is a script to verify file encodings. It will ensure that none text files in the repository (identified as text by Git) have `\r\n` line endings or UTF-8 BOM attached to them.

Usage
-----

### Local Run
```console
$ pwsh Test-Encoding.ps1 [[-SourceRoot] <SourceRoot>] [-Autofix]
```

Where
- `SourceRoot` is the directory where the script will look for the files. By default, the script will consider the parent of the script directory as the source root.
- `-Autofix` will apply fixes to all the problematic files.

### CI
Add the following block to your CI script (here I'll use GitHub Actions, but it's use to adapt to any other CI provider):
```yaml
jobs:
  encoding:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
    # [â€¦]
    - name: Verify encoding
      shell: pwsh
      run: scripts/Test-Encoding.ps1
```
Script will generate a non-zero exit code in case there's a validation error, and list all the files with issues.
